# BookingFlow — Complete Product Information

## Product Overview

BookingFlow is a comprehensive booking automation platform designed specifically for escape rooms, entertainment venues, and experience-based businesses that operate on a time-slot reservation model.

The platform was built to solve a specific problem: most escape rooms and small entertainment venues rely on phone calls, manual scheduling, and fragmented tools. This leads to missed bookings, high no-show rates, and staff time wasted answering repetitive questions.

BookingFlow consolidates the entire booking workflow into one system:
1. Customer discovers the venue online or calls
2. BookingFlow handles inquiries through chatbot or voice agent
3. Customer sees real-time availability and completes booking
4. Payment is collected upfront via Stripe
5. Automated emails handle confirmations, reminders, and follow-ups
6. Venue staff focuses on delivering great experiences

## Common Questions

**Q: How long does setup take?**
A: Most venues are live in 10-15 minutes. You add your rooms, set your schedule, connect Stripe, and copy the widget code to your website.

**Q: Do I need to replace my existing website?**
A: No. BookingFlow is a booking layer that sits on top of your existing website. You add one snippet of code and the booking widget appears.

**Q: What if someone wants to book a time slot that is not available?**
A: The system shows only real-time available slots. If a slot is booked, it disappears from the calendar immediately. No overbooking is possible.

**Q: Can customers book by phone?**
A: Yes. The voice agent answers calls and can complete bookings over the phone. You can also transfer calls to staff if needed.

**Q: What about no-shows?**
A: Venues that collect full payment upfront see no-show rates under 5%. Those that do not charge upfront see 20-30% no-shows. BookingFlow supports both models, but recommends upfront payment.

**Q: Can I still take walk-in customers?**
A: Absolutely. BookingFlow manages your online and phone bookings. Walk-ins are handled the same way you currently handle them.

**Q: What if I need help setting up?**
A: Pro and Business plans include priority support. We also offer white-glove onboarding for a one-time fee.
